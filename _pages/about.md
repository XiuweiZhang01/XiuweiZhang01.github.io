**Xiuwei Zhang** recently graduated from the [University of Bristol](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/), where he earned an MSc in *Optical Communications & Signal Processing* (2023–2025).  
His master’s thesis, *Covert Quantum Rangefinding in High-Noise Environments*, was conducted under the supervision of [Professor John G. Rarity](https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/persons/john-g-rarity), a recipient of the [2023 Micius Quantum Prize](https://miciusprize.org/).  

Prior to his master’s studies, he obtained a BEng in *Electronic Engineering* from the [University of Central Lancashire (UCLan)](https://www.uclan.ac.uk/) (2020–2023).  

His research interests encompass **computer vision**, **signal processing**, **quantum technologies**, and **artificial intelligence (AI)**. He is particularly interested in exploring how **intelligent algorithms** and **quantum-inspired methods** can complement each other to advance **covert, reliable, and energy-efficient communication and sensing systems**.  

Beyond his **primary research domains**, Xiuwei is deeply committed to **interdisciplinary research**, believing that the most impactful innovations often emerge at the interface of physics, engineering, and artificial intelligence.
